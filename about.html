<p>In the silence of dawn, where dreams take flight,<br>
Lives a soul named Kavya, bathed in light.<br>
Not just a name, but a verse set free,<br>
A rhythm of heartbeats, wild and carefree.<br>

Her words are whispers, soft as rain,<br>
Washing away sorrow, easing pain.<br>
In every glance, a story flows,<br>
In every smile, a garden grows.<br>

She speaks in colors the world can't see,<br>
A brush of moonlight, wild and free.<br>
A thinker, a seeker, a gentle flame,<br>
Grace and depth behind her name.<br>

For Kavya is more than just letters aligned,<br>
She's the poetry the world longs to find.<br>
